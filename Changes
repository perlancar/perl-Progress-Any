        Happy birthday, bro!

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Revise API, now more resembles Log::Any and incompatible with previous
          version of Progress::Any. Split output to Progress-Any-Output (like
          Log-Any-Adapter is split from Log-Any), remove set_output(). Remove
          init() and replace it with pos() and target() because we might need to
          reinit (reset pos and target) any time. Remove 'inc' argument in
          update() to make things more orthogonal (you can always do update(pos
          => $progress->pos + $x). Check task syntax in get_indicator().

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - API: parent indicators now get update()'d also whenever we do
          update()/pos($val)/target($val) on an indicator.

        - Progress::Any is now the one which is responsible for calculating
          elapsed time/ETA/% completion. Output now just displays stuffs. This
          makes output simpler and reduce duplicated code.
