0.214   2018-03-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Forget to remove old code.


0.213   2018-03-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Incompatible change] [internal] Remove output_data structure, store
	  state in output objects directly. This simplifies things a bit.

	- [Bugfix][Regression] Initialize parent indicators with target=0
	  so percent-completion can be calculated.


0.212   2018-03-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Make regex to parse template available as package variable
          '$template_regex'.

        - fill_template(): Accept handle_unknown_conversion option to handle
          unknown conversion.


0.211   2018-03-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Incompatible change] update(): Rename 'level' argument to 'priority'.
          High-priority updates are now not frequency-throttled.

        - [Bugfix] Indicator object's target was not initially set to undef but
          to 0.

        - Don't frequency-throttle update to output that has freq = 0.

        - Read output module data via output_data().

        - [doc] Fix/update/add examples.


0.210   2018-03-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Observe PROGRESS environment variable to let user turn off
	  progress updating.


0.20    2015-01-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Merge Progress::Any::Output back from separate distribution
	  Progress-Any-Output to Progress-Any (similar to what is done with
	  Log-Any vs Log-Any-Adapter).


0.19    2015-01-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Allow message to be coderef for delaying costly calculation, will
	  be converted to string when sent to output.


0.18    2014-10-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Work around Pod::Weaver's quirks (the screenshots HTML ended up
	  in the Status section).


0.17    2014-10-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Include screenshots.


0.16    2014-10-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - No functional changes.

        - Show usage example with Perinci::CmdLine.


0.15    2014-07-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes.

        - Fix Synopsis [RT#97563].


0.14    2014-05-01  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes.

        - Temporarily make template test release testing only due to being
          timing-related and fail on some CT machines [CT].


0.13    2014-02-26  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Add frequency limiting for updating outputs. Currently set at (at most
          per) 0.5s. Will be configurable in the future.


0.12    2013-09-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Temporarily put some tests (elapsed, etc) on
          RELEASE_TESTING due to fragility of timing/sleep. Will need to use
          time mocking in the future [CT].


0.11    2013-09-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Increase granularity of elapsed tests from
          0.05s to 1s due to faliure in many systems [CT].


0.10    2013-09-03  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Rework internals and some API. This is the second API revision.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Allow reinitializing 'pos' and 'target'  Released-By: and all other rw attributes
          at subsequent get_indicator() for the same task. This is to make
          program more predictable, instead of silently ignoring parameters.

        - Allow indicator to be start()'ed and stop()'ed at any time.

        - Add task title (in addition to its name).

        - Allow specifying estimated remaining of a task when creating an
          indicator, via passing 'remaining'.

        - New fill templates: %r (remaining time), %R (remaining time or elapsed
          time).

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - The $progress export is now set to the root ('') indicator instead of
          'main', so it includes all indicators.

        - fill_template(): re-rationalize template names: %a  Released-By: elapsed time
          becomes %e, %c (pos) becomes %P, %C (target) becomes %T, %t (task
          name) becomes %n.

        [REMOVED FEATURES]

        - Remove 'status' in update() because it is unneeded (concerning outputs
          can use 'message' instead).


0.09    2013-05-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Bugfix: double counting of children's targets.


0.08    2013-05-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Bugfix: update() didn't recognize 'finished' parameter.

        - Maintain a root-level indicator (task='') to capture updates from all
          progress indicators.


0.07    2013-05-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add total_target().


0.06    2013-05-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Change default task in get_indicator() to be caller's package, not
          subroutine.


0.05    2013-05-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO; Note: Happy birthday, bro!

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Revise API, now more resembles Log::Any and incompatible with previous
          version of Progress::Any. Split output to Progress-Any-Output (like
          Log-Any-Adapter is split from Log-Any), remove set_output(). Remove
          init() and replace it with pos() and target() because we might need to
          reinit (reset pos and target) any time. Remove 'inc' argument in
          update() to make things more orthogonal (you can always do update(pos
          => $progress->pos + $x). Check task syntax in get_indicator().

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - API: parent indicators now get update()'d also whenever we do
          update()/pos($val)/target($val) on an indicator.

        - Progress::Any is now the one which is responsible for calculating
          elapsed time/ETA/% completion. Output now just displays stuffs. This
          makes output simpler and reduce duplicated code.

0.02    2012-10-24  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Some tweaks/fixes: don't pre-init $progress, give default message to
          reset() and finish().


0.01    2012-10-24  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - First, early release.
